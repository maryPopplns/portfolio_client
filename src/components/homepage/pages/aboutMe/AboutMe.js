        Hello! My name is Spencer Knight, I am a US Navy veteran, fitness
        enthusiast, and full stack JavaScript developer. Solving problems
        whether it's aircraft, fitness, or software related is what I like to
        do. Front-end development is my current passion, but am confident I will
        thrive in any environment. Checkout my blog/projects and tell me what
        you think!
